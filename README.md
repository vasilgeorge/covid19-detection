# covid19-detection


Covid19-detection is a Machine Learning model used to detect Covid19 from patients' chest X-Rays images taken from here: https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT.

The Machine Learning model used in this work is a Random Forest Classifier that classifies an X-Ray image as positive or negative implying whether the patient has contracted Covid19 or not with a 95% detection accuracy.

The feature vector passed to the Random Forest Classifier consists of features extracted from the GLCM matrix of the chest X-Ray image after it has been denoised and has the lungs segmented from the original image.
